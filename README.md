# **#brutal**

This is a mushclient plugin and has been coded by wazimu for use on icesus.org, it is under testing, and may contain bugs and have features not suitable for you.

I recommend to creating a new world in mushclient before installing this plugin. also good to keep a backup copy of your ingame prompt settings. This plugin modifies your ingame prompt and can potentially break your other triggers/aliases.

**You have been warned!**

This plugin will add an infobar and a floating miniwindow in mushclient
